# React Patterns Showcase

**React Patterns Showcase** is a demo project designed to showcase various React design patterns, including **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**, **Render Props**, **Compound Components**, **Context API**, and **Controlled Components**. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience to help developers understand how these patterns can improve component reusability, state management, and overall code structure in React applications.

## Features

- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Demonstrates how to wrap components to add extra behavior or logic without modifying the original component.
- **Render Props**: Showcases the flexibility of passing a function as a prop to control component rendering dynamically.
- **Compound Components**: A pattern that allows for a better, more declarative composition of related components, all managed by a parent component.
- **Context API**: Uses React's Context API to demonstrate how shared global state can be managed across components without prop drilling.
- **Controlled Components**: Illustrates how parent components manage child component states, typically used for forms and input handling.

## Demo

To see the patterns in action, you can explore the following:

- **Dashboard** (protected by HOC authentication)
- **MouseTracker** (using Render Props to track mouse position)
- **Tab System** (demonstrating Compound Components)
- **TextInput** (controlled form component)
- **Themed Components** (using Context API for theme management)
